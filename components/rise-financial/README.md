# Financial Web Component [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-financial/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-financial/tree/master)

## Introduction

`rise-financial` is a Polymer Web Component that works together with the [Rise Vision Financial Selector](https://selector.risevision.com/), a web app for managing financial content. It retrieves the financial list and its corresponding instruments from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Data is refreshed in realtime, so any changes that are made to a particular financial list in the Financial Selector are immediately propagated to the `rise-financial` component.

## Usage
To use `rise-financial`, you should first install it using Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-financial.git
```

Next, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents-lite.min.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web component using an [HTML import](http://webcomponents.org/articles/introduction-to-html-imports/).

### Example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-financial/rise-financial.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <rise-financial
      financial-list="my-list"
      instrument-fields='["instrument", "name", "lastPrice", "netChange"]'>
    </rise-financial>

    <script>
      // Listen for "WebComponentsReady" event.
      window.addEventListener( "WebComponentsReady", function( e ) {
        const financial = document.querySelector( "rise-financial" );

        financial.addEventListener( "rise-financial-response", ( e ) => {
          console.log( e.detail );
        } );
        
        financial.addEventListener( "rise-financial-no-data", ( e ) => {
          console.log( "No data available" );
        } );

        // Request the financial data.
        financial.go();
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Realtime Data
To request realtime data, the `type` attribute can either be left off or it can be set to `realtime`.

Valid values for the `instrument-fields` attribute for realtime data are: `accumulatedVolume`, `ask`, `bid`, `code`, `dayHigh`, `dayLow`, `daysOfWeek`, `endTime`, `historicClose`, `instrument`, `lastPrice`, `name`, `netChange`, `percentChange`, `startTime`, `timeZone`, `timeZoneOffset`, `tradeTime`, `updateInterval`, `yearHigh`, `yearLow`, `yield` and `yieldChange`.

If no `instrument-fields` attribute is provided, all fields are returned by default.

#### Example

```
<rise-financial
  financial-list="my-list"
  instrument-fields='["instrument", "name"]'>
</rise-financial>
```

### Historical Data
To request historical data, the `type` attribute must be set to `historical` and `duration` must be set to one of: `Day`, `Week`, `1M`, `3M`, `6M`, `1Y` or `5Y`.

Valid values for the `instrument-fields` attribute for historical data are: `accumulatedVolume`, `closePrice`, `intervalVolume`, `percentChange` and `tradeTime`.

If no `instrument-fields` attribute is provided, all fields are returned by default.

#### Example

```
<rise-financial
  duration="1M"
  financial-list="my-list"
  instrument-fields='["closePrice", "percentChange"]'
  type="historical">
</rise-financial>
```

### Response Object

`rise-financial` returns an object of the following format:

![rise-financial data](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1190420/21622351/1b53131c-d1cb-11e6-8ae3-2d1e2fb9049d.png)

_data_ is an object with _cols_ and _rows_ properties, where _cols_ is an array that contains additional information about the requested fields, and _rows_ is an array that contains the actual data.

_instruments_ is an object that provides details about every instrument found in the financial list.

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.
* [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - A simple web server for using bower components locally.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.
- [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - To install Polyserve, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g polyserve`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g polyserve`.

The web components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-financial.git
cd rise-financial
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
To access the demo locally, run the following command in Terminal: `polyserve`

Now in your browser, navigate to:

```
localhost:8080/components/rise-financial/demo/index.html
```

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests either by command terminal or via a local web server using Polyserve.

#### Command Terminal
Execute the following command in Terminal to run tests:

```
NODE_ENV=test yarn run test
```

#### Local Server
Run the following command in Terminal: `polyserve`.

Now in your browser, navigate to:

```
localhost:8080/components/rise-financial/test/index.html
```

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the contents of the `bower_components` folder to a folder on your server and also create a `rise-financial` folder within your folder and upload `rise-financial.html` to it. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions.
